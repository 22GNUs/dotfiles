# Language

**Prioritize Simplified Chinese (简体中文)** but **respect file context**.

1. **Context First:** Match the existing language style when editing files (e.g., keep English docs in English).
2. **Communication:** Use Chinese for explanations, commits, and reasoning by default.
3. **Code:** Always use English for syntax and naming.
